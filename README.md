# DeCoster.design GRAV portfolio prototype

Building out a test site for my new portfolio site using grav and a couple of custom themes.

The first theme is for the portfolio site, and the subtheme is for thew resume section of the site. This is very much a rolling engine stand of a site and I'm not entirely sure I am going to go this route so I am using this to explore building a portfolio site using GRAV.

## Development

There has been a fair amount of work done so far, though it hasn't been tracked in git so far. Just one big ass single commit. Kind of embarrassing actually. Not how I like to work in git, but I've been focusing on the theming more than anything else.
