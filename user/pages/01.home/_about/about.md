<h2 class="section-title">About <span>Me</span></h2>
### Designer, Developer and general web junky

I've been bending the web to my will for more than a dozen years. Whether it's been building enterprise e-commerce sites, customizing Wordpress, writing custom JavaScript or making use of jQuery to fine tune interaction, building and designing for the web is my passion.

In my grab-bag of tools you'll find Sass, jQuery, Foundation, PHP, Ember and others being coerced into playing nice.

I don't ignore our mobile friends either. I build responsive sites that are designed for a cohesive, singular experience regardless of the size of the screen you use.

All the while keeping the Social aspect close at hand, working with Marketing teams to incorporate the web presence into social markets to further enhance reach and expand the conversation.
