## Skills
### Designer, Developer and general web junky

In my grab-bag of tools you'll find Sass, jQuery, Foundation, PHP, React, Ember and others being coerced into playing nice.

I don't ignore our mobile friends either. I build responsive sites that are designed for a cohesive, singular experience regardless of the size of the screen it's viewed on.

All the while keeping the Social aspect close at hand, working with Marketing teams to incorporate the web presence into social markets to further enhance reach and expand the conversation.
